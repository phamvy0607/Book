                        <p> On her 28th birthday, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) meets Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), 
                            the son she gave up for adoption 10 years ago. Henry believes Emma is 
                            the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), 
                            prophesied to be the Savior that will break the powerful curse the Evil Queen casted. 
                            Unconvinced, Emma returns Henry to Storybrooke, where she encounters the enigmatic 
                            Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) and clashes with mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla) - the boy's 
                            adoptive mother - who Henry insists is none other than the Evil Queen!

                            Reality and myth merged as the fairytale characters began awakening once 
                            the curse was lifted and remembered who they were. 
                            But to their dismay, they weren't transported back to fairytale land. 
                            To make matters worse, Rumplestiltskin - a.k.a. Mr. Gold - decided to gain 
                            the upper hand in his power struggle with Regina and introduced magic into the town. 
                            But this is our world, and magic has a tendency to have unfathomable implications.

                    <h3>David (James) - Prince Charming</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p> David was born into a family of shepherds, unaware that he had a twin brother who was adopted 
                        by the King. When his brother died, David was brought in to replace him, eventually defying 
                        the King's wishes by falling in love with the bandit Snow White. He went on to rule at her side 
                        and the two of them even conceived a child - the product of true love. However, when the Evil Queen 
                        enacts the Dark Curse, the prince finally wakes up in the town of Storybrooke, Maine, it's after 
                        having spent 28 years in a coma as David Nolan, whose love for Mary Margaret. Eventually, 
                        the curse is broken though, and his noble side is re-established along with his marriage and 
                        the chance to start over with a new baby boy.
